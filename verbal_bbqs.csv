University of Texas climate scientist Geeta Persad and her colleagues simulated how the amount of water entering aquifers and the amount being used for irrigation purposes would change if this were to occur. Persad and her colleagues concluded that concentration of precipitation into fewer events would result in a higher number of dry days, triggering more irrigation, but that this change in irrigation output is highly sensitive to the baseline concentration of precipitation that currently exists in an area. Which choice best describes data from the table that support Persad and her colleaguesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ conclusion?"

014b3394,INFO_IDEAS,Command of Evidence,,BB10 UPPER,"Average Number and Duration of Torpor Bouts and Arousal Episodes for Alaska Marmots and Arctic Ground Squirrels, 2008Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2011 Feature Alaska marmots Arctic ground squirrels torpor bouts 12 10.5 duration per bout 13.81 days 16.77 days arousal episodes 11 9.5 duration per episode 21.2 hours 14.2 hours When hibernating, Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels enter a state called torpor, which minimizes the energy their bodies need to function. Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn less energy keeping warm during these episodes than they would if they were alone. A researcher hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots. Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hypothesis?"
0198240a,INFO_IDEAS,Command of Evidence,,BB6 UPPER,"Under normal atmospheric pressure at EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surface, water molecules form a tetrahedral network stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules. Extreme high pressure, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds and compresses waterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s structure, allowing water molecules within organisms to permeate proteins and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive correlation between the depths that various piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a compound called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces waterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compressibility. Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hypothesis?"

02fd3da7,CRAFT,Cross-Text Connections,,,"Text 1 Public policy researcher Anthony Fowler studied the history of elections in Australia, a country that requires citizens to vote. Fowler argues that requiring citizens to vote leads to a significant increase in voters who would otherwise not have the time or motivation to vote. Thus, election results in countries that require citizens to vote better reflect the preferences of the country as a whole.Ã‚ Ã‚ Text 2 Governments in democratic countries function better when more people vote. However, forcing people to vote may have negative consequences. Shane P. Singh and Jason Roy studied what happens when a country requires its citizens to vote. They found that when people feel forced to vote, they tend to spend less time looking for information about their choices when voting. As a result, votes from these voters may not reflect their actual preferences. Based on the texts, how would Singh and Roy (Text 2) most likely respond to the research discussed in Text 1?"

03e5cf33,INFO_IDEAS,Command of Evidence,,BB10 MEDIUM,"Many insects are iridescent, or have colors that appear to shimmer and change when seen from different angles. Scientists have assumed that this feature helps to attract mates but could also attract predators. But biologist Karin Kjernsmo and a team had the idea that the shifting appearance of colors might actually make it harder for other animals to see iridescent insects. To test this idea, the team put beetle forewings on leaves along a forest path and then asked human participants to look for them. Some of the wings were naturally iridescent. Others were painted with a nonchanging color from the iridescent spectrum, such as purple or blue. Which finding, if true, would most directly support the teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s idea?"

By definition, literature tells a story or conveys meaning through language only; graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and use language only sparingly, in captions and dialogue. Graphic novels are experienced as series of images and not as language, making them more similar to film than to literature. Ã‚ Text 2 Graphic novels present their stories through both language and images. Without captions and dialogue, readers would be unable to understand what is depicted in the illustrations: the story results from the interaction of text and image. Moreover, Alison BechdelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fun Home and many other graphic novels feature text that is as beautifully written as the prose found in many standard novels. Therefore, graphic novels qualify as literary texts. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the overall argument presented in Text 1?"

As the researchers fitted each magpie with a tracker attached by a small harness, they noticed some magpies without trackers pecking at another magpieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tracker until it broke off. The researchers suggest that this behavior could be evidence of magpies attempting to help another magpie without benefiting themselves. Ã‚ Text 2 It can be tempting to think that animals are deliberately providing help when we see them removing trackers and other equipment from one another, especially when a species is known to exhibit other cooperative behaviors.
